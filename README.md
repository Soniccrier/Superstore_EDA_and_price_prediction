# Superstore Profit Prediction

This project explores retail sales data from the Superstore dataset to uncover business insights and build a predictive model that estimates profit based on key sales features. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning using a **Random Forest Regressor**.

## üìä Project Overview

Retail businesses rely on data-driven insights to optimize sales and improve profitability.  
This project analyzes Superstore transactional data to:

- Identify top-performing countries, states, and categories.
- Examine how discounts and sales influence profit.
- Predict profit margins using machine learning.

## üîç Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
   - Separated categorical and numerical columns.
   - Encoded categorical variables with `OneHotEncoder`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized sales and profit trends by country, category, and discount range.
   - Created comparative bar charts to show top-performing regions.
   - Identified correlations between sales, discounts, and profit.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selected relevant features affecting profit.
   - Applied transformations for model readiness.

4. **Model Development**
   - Split the data into training and test sets (`80/20`).
   - Built a pipeline combining preprocessing and a **Random Forest Regressor**.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **R¬≤**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**.

## üìà Visual Insights

Key visualizations include:
- **Top 10 Countries by Sales and Profit**
- **Average Profit Margin by Discount Range**
- **Sales vs. Profit Distribution**
- **Category-Level Profit Comparison**

These visualizations reveal where profitability peaks and where discounts may reduce margins, helping businesses refine pricing and promotional strategies.

## ü§ñ Model Performance

The **Random Forest Regressor** provided robust predictive accuracy with good generalization to unseen data.  
Evaluation metrics (example):
- R¬≤ Score: ~0.69  
- MAE: ~35.88  
- RMSE: ~400  

*(Metrics may vary slightly depending on parameter tuning.)*
